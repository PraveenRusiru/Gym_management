## 🏗️ System Architecture (Layered Architecture)

The application follows a **4-layer architecture**:

### 1️⃣ Presentation Layer
- JavaFX-based user interface  
- FXML layouts designed using Scene Builder  
- Handles user interactions and UI logic  

### 2️⃣ Service / Business Logic Layer
- Contains business rules and validations  
- Processes data before passing it to the DAO layer  
- Acts as a bridge between UI and database layers  

### 3️⃣ Data Access Layer (DAO)
- Uses JDBC for database operations  
- Handles CRUD operations  
- Separates database logic from business logic  

### 4️⃣ Database Layer
- MySQL relational database  
- Uses constraints, foreign keys, and normalization  
- Securely stores client, workout, nutrition, and payment data
